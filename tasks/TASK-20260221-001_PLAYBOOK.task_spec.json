  "instructions": [
    "Create a new file PLAYBOOK.md at the repo root.",
    "PLAYBOOK.md must be written in Chinese (you may include short English command snippets).",
    "Content requirements (keep it practical, not essay):",
    "- Purpose & scope: this repo is a long-term playground.",
    "- Roles: what Zero can do vs what the human must do (clearly labeled).",
    "- Standard workflow (the minimal loop): write TaskSpec → run codex exec → run tests → validate TaskResult → commit/push.",
    "- Provide PowerShell command templates for: creating venv + installing requirements; running pytest; validating a TaskResult JSON.",
    "- Provide a codex exec prompt template that references a TaskSpec file and requires ONLY TaskResult JSON output.",
    "- Brief section on scaling: /new /fork /resume and when to use git worktree.",
    "- Keep it <= ~150 lines; prefer bullet lists.",
    "If needed to satisfy Codex --output-schema constraints, you may update docs/contracts/task_result_v0_1.schema.json required fields (no other behavioral changes).",
    "Do NOT change any other files."
